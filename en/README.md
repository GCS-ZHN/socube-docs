### 1.1 Basic Information

SoCube V1.0 is terminal command-based software written in Python without a visual user interface (GUI), and can run on any computing server, personal computer, etc. that can run the Python language.

### 1.2 Writing Purpose

The User Manual of ZJU Single Cell High Throughput Sequencing Dimer Assay Software (V1.0) (hereinafter referred to as "the Manual") is a user's guide for ZJU Single Cell High Throughput Sequencing Dimer Assay Software (V1.0).

### 1.3 Background

High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used in biomedical research [1-6]. However, due to the limitations of sequencing technology, a dimer (or multimer) formed by the combination of two (or more) cells will be generated during the sequencing process. Dimers are equivalent to a cell type that is not otherwise present in the sample and can severely interfere with the true statistical distribution of cells and genes, hereby affecting downstream studies with distribution dependence [7]. Therefore, the Laboratory of Innovative Drug Research and Bioinformatics at Zhejiang University (hereinafter referred to as "we") developed SoCube to detect dimers generating in single-cell high-throughput sequencing.
